# Liquid staking

## How divETH works for users

When a Staker deposits 1 ETH, they obtain 1 divETH. As days pass and rewards are generated, the divETH balance grows to reflect the underlying value of its ETH. The Staker now holds 1.01 divETH, 1.02 divETH, etc.

1 divETH always represents an underlyer of 1 ETH kept in Diva.

1 divETH can be unstaked by Diva, by requesting a withdrawal and obtaining the underlying ETH after the withdrawal completes. This functionality will be available once Ethereum allows validator withdrawals, expected in 2023.

Because 1 divETH is always worth 1 ETH, it should trade as approximately 1 ETH in Defi.

## The divETH liquid staking model

divETH is a rebasing token. Balances can be used like regular ETH to earn and lending rewards, and are updated on a daily basis to reflect your ETH staking rewards. There are no lock-ups or minimum deposits.

Rebasing tokens have the best user experience and it is fully integrated in the DeFI ecosystem. Unlike other approaches, divETH keeps always the rate 1:1 with ETH and automatically receives the staking rewards.


## The wdivETH wrapping option

In case you prefer a non-rebasing, wdivETH is an alternative where the balance is not updated daily. Instead, 1 wdivETH represents the value of 1 ETH staked with Diva at the launch of the contract. As such, wdivETH appreciates versus ETH over time, similar to shares in an investment fund that appreciated over time vs USD.

Possible reasons to prefer wdivETH may be taxes or technical reasons, when integrating it in Defi pools for example.

It is possible to wrap the divETH into wdivETH, which is an ERC20 token. wdivETH does not do rebasing therefore the balance it remains the same. Instead to be 1:1 with the value of one ETH. The value now will be set to a % of the total rewards on Diva.


## divETH vs wdivETH

1 divETH = 1 ETH at any moment. Your divETH balance will increment daily to reflect your staking rewards. For example, 1 divETH today will make you to have 1,05 divETH within one year. 1 divETH is backed by 1 ETH all the time. That's why is growing, because that ETH is generating yield from rewards.

1 wdivETH reflects the rewards that 1 ETH has generated from the very beginning of Diva.

By depositing 1 ETH, you get 1 divETH that is < 1 wdivETH. The wdivETH balance does not change. But that wdivETH is backed by a growing amount of ETH every day. So the value of each wdivETH is higher and higher every day.

Another way of thinking about this is divETH is your "ETH balance" (which grows daily), while wdivETH is how many "shares" you hold from the total Diva pool (which only changes if you trade it).
