title: Diva â€“ A liquid staking protocol powered by distributed validators
numbersections: true
abstract: |
  Diva is a non-custodial (Liquid Staking + Distributed Validation) network. It is a vertically integrated protocol that offers depositors a liquid staking token that accrues value with staking rewards automatically without the need of running any infrastructure or trusting any central party. The network performs Distributed Validation with a group of independent node operators that fulfill staking duties with a non-custodial model. Besides, it distributes staking rewards among the participants of this cooperative: Stakers, Operators, and the Diva DAO to balance the interests of the network.
