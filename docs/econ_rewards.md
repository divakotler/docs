# Ethereum rewards

### Consensus rewards 
The rewards of the consensus layer are determined by the Ethereum protocol
specifications. They depend on the number of active validators. The rewards are locked by the Ethereum
protocol under Diva smart contracts. Once available they will be used to redeem the divETH for ETH or for auto-compounding. Unless the validators are partial or fully withdrawn, the rewards are locked in the consensus layer. 

There are three kind of consensus rewards:

- Attestation	
- Block Proposal	
- Sync Committee

### Execution rewards 
Ethereum execution rewards can be significantly higher because of the use of MEV.
When a validator is proposing a block, it can be done in such a way to maximize the value by creating a
customized block. Diva takes advantage of this to improve the overall APR. These rewards are liquid, each time a validator proposes a block, Diva will receive these rewards instantly. 

There are two kind of execution rewards:

- Priority Fees	
- MEV Rewards
