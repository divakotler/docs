# First Distribution

Approximately **20,000 addresses from Ethereum community members** have being offered the chance to become early Diva DAO participants.

The recipients of the DIVA First Distribution include:

- **Diva OG contributors**, including early supporters, researchers, developers, advisors, and community members.
- **Ethereum Stakers** from EthStaker, Rocketpool, SSV, Lido, Dappnode, etc.
- **Community members** from Gnosis, Uniswap, ENS, AAVE, Bankless, Aragon and other DAOs.
- **Ethereum staking dev** and ecosystem contributors.

## The purpose

The purpose of this *initial* distribution is to involve potential Diva users in the design of the protocol as early as possible, building a system that has decentralization at its core.

Delegated token holders are tasked with the goal of shaping the protocol and increasing its utility, resiliency, and decentralization.

Further initiatives should take place to further distribute and decentralize Diva governance power.


## Further distribution

The DIVA token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000,000 DIVA.

The ultimate goal is to distribute the entirety of the supply to community members, with a suggested target of delivering:

- 10% First Distribution as detailed above.
- 10% Staking Foundation for research, development and promotion.
- 15% for Early Stakers and Operators.
- 25% for DAO reserves and future R&D.
- 40% for Early Supporters of the project.

The goal is to maximize decentralization, assigning governance power to active network participants.

## Non-transferability

**The DIVA tokens, at the time of launch, are characterized as non-transferable and valueless.**

Many token launches experience issues of information asymmetry, which can lead to unfair conditions for potential participants.

To counteract this, DIVA tokens are introduced as non-transferable, eliminating any speculative interest that might negatively impact decentralization and distribution fairness.

The decision regarding future transferability of the token will rest with DIVA's delegated token holders, ensuring decisions are made in the best interest of the community.

Ideally, the token will maintain its non-transferable status until transferability becomes necessary for operational functionality and the advancement of decentralization.

## Distribution Restrictions

Due to legal uncertainities surrounding staking operations in the US and Canada, US and Canadian nationals are excluded from the Early Distribution.

Several other sanctioned countries have been excluded as well.
