# First Distribution

A selection of community members are being offered the chance to become early DIVA holders.

The recipients of the DIVA First Distribution include:

- **OG contributors**, including early supporters, researchers, developers, advisors, and community members.
- **Ethereum Stakers** from different communities.
- A diverse selection of Ethereum contributors and community members.

The purpose of this initial distribution is to involve potential Diva users in the design of the protocol as early as possible.

This early distribution represents Divaâ€™s commitment to building a system that has decentralization at its core.

Delegated token holders are tasked with the goal of shaping the protocol and increasing its utility, resiliency, and decentralization.


## Future token distribution

The DIVA token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000,000 DIVA.

The ultimate goal is to distribute the entirety of the supply to community members, with an approximate target of delivering:

- 56% community allocation for Stakers, Operators, Contributors.
- 44% distributed to Key Community Members, including:
    - Diva Contributors involved with the protocol R&D.
    - Key Ethereum community members, including stakers, node operators, delegates, and developers.
    - Early adopters committed to staking or running nodes with Diva.

## Non-transferability

**The DIVA tokens, at the time of launch, are characterized as non-transferable and valueless.**

Many token launches experience issues of information asymmetry, which can lead to unfair conditions for potential participants.

To counteract this, DIVA tokens are introduced as non-transferable, eliminating any speculative interest that might negatively impact decentralization and fairness.

The decision regarding future transferability of the token will rest with DIVA's delegated token holders, ensuring decisions are made in the best interest of the community.

Ideally, the token will maintain its non-transferable status until transferability becomes necessary for operational functionality and the advancement of decentralization.

### Restricted to non-US nationals

Due to legal uncertainities surrounding staking operations in the United Stated of America, the initial distribution was restricted to non-US nationals.
