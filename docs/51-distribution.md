# First Distribution

A selection of community members are being offered the chance to become early DIVA holders.

The recipients of the DIVA First Distribution include:

- **OG contributors**, including early supporters, researchers, developers, advisors, and community members.
- **Ethereum Stakers** from different communities.
- A diverse selection of Ethereum contributors and community members.

The purpose of this initial distribution is to involve potential Diva users in the design of the protocol as early as possible.

This early distribution represents Divaâ€™s commitment to building a system that has decentralization at its core.

Delegated token holders are tasked with the goal of shaping the protocol and increasing its utility, resiliency, and decentralization.


## Future token distribution

The DIVA token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000,000 DIVA.

The ultimate goal is to distribute the entirety of the supply to community members, with an approximate target of delivering:

- 56% community allocation for Stakers, Operators, Contributors.
- 44% distributed to Key Community Members, including:
    - Diva Contributors involved with the protocol R&D.
    - Key Ethereum community members, including stakers, node operators, delegates, and developers.
    - Early adopters committed to staking or running nodes with Diva.

## Non-transferrability

**DIVA tokens are being launched as non-transferable and valueless.**

Many token launches suffer from information asymmetry, leading to unfairness between potential participants.

In order to prevent this, DIVA tokens are released as non-transferable to avoid any speculative interest which might be detrimental to decentralization and fairness.

It will be up to DIVA's delegated token holders to decide upon the future transferability of the token to the best interest of the community.

Ideally the token remains non-transferable until it's strictly required for operational and decentralization purposes.
