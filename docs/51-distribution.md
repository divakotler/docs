# Initial distribution

## Token distribution

The DIVA token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000,000 DIVA.

An initial distribution has been performed to representative members of the community to decide on further steps towards decentralization.

The current allocations are:

- 56% community allocation for Stakers, Operators, R&D, Insurance, etc.
- 44% distributed to Key Community Members, including:
    - Diva Contributors involved with the protocol R&D.
    - Key Ethereum community members, including stakers, node operators, delegates, and developers.
    - Early adopters committed to staking or running nodes with Diva.

Token holders are tasked with the goal of shaping the protocol and increasing its utility, resiliency, and decentralization.

## Non-transferrability

Many token launches suffer from information opacity, leading to unfairness between potential participants.

In order to prevent this, DIVA tokens are being launched as non-transferable, to allow early community members to deciding on the suitability of whether and when the DIVA token shall become transferable.

This way the token launch becomes a more decentralized and fair process, that can take launch whenever the DAO has adequately assessed its implications.

In an ideal scenario, the token remains non-transferable until it's strictly required for operational and decentralization purposes, and the design for the protocol has been fully finalized.
