# Diva's Liquid Staking

:::important
This is an independent guide to Diva Staking, maintained by the [Staking Foundation](foundation).
:::

Diva is an Ethereum Liquid Staking protocol powered by Distributed Validator Technology (DVT).

It is a fully integrated tool that improves the lives of Stakers and Operators:

- **Stakers** receive a Liquid Staking Token (divETH), which automatically accrues value from Ethereum's staking rewards without needing to run any infrastructure.
- **Operators** run a Distributed Validation (Diva) client to fulfill staking duties and earn staking rewards.

Ethereum’s staking rewards are distributed among the diva protocol participants according to their contributions.

While other solutions have some of these features, **Diva is the first protocol that fully integrates Liquid Staking with DVT**, offering Stakers and Operators the most efficient solution.

## Diva Rewrites the Rules

### Validator Design

- 🌳 Resilient: Nodes are fully disposable.
- ❤️‍🔥 Self-healing: Ability to recover full network liveliness by regenerating keys.
- 💠 Redundancy: Up to 500x better uptime thanks to DVT fallbacks.

### Incentives and Penalties

- 📈 Aggregated smooth rewards.
- ⛔️ Quick ejection of bad actors.

### Trust-minimized Architecture

- 🔐 "Can't be evil" cryptoeconomic systems
- 🛡️ [Collateral guarantees from operators](participants#operators)
