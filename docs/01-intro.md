# Diva's Liquid Staking

Diva is an Ethereum Liquid Staking protocol powered by Distributed Validator Technology (DVT).

It extends Ethereum's Proof of Stake providing new functionality for Stakers and Operators:

- **Liquid Stakers** receive a Liquid Staking Token (divETH), which automatically accrues value from Ethereum's staking rewards without needing to run any infrastructure.
- **Operators** run a Distributed Validation (Diva) client to fulfill staking duties and earn staking rewards.

Ethereum’s staking rewards are distributed among the diva protocol participants according to their contributions.

While other solutions have some of these features, **Diva is the first solution that fully integrates Liquid Staking with DVT**, offering both Liquid Stakers and Operators the most efficient functionality.

## Diva Rewrites the Rules

### Liquid Staking

- 🌱 No minimum ETH to stake.
- 👏 No requirement to run a node.
- 💧 [Liquid Staking Tokens](lst) without lockups.

### More Resilient Operations

- 🌳 Resilient: Nodes are fully disposable.
- ❤️‍🔥 Self-healing: Ability to regenerate lost keys.
- 💠 Redundancy: ~500x better uptime thanks to DVT fallbacks.

### Incentives and Penalties

- 📈 Smooth network rewards.
- ⛔️ Quick ejection of bad actors.

### Trust-minimized Architecture

- 🪨 Trustless and permissionless.
- 🔐 "Can't be evil" cryptoeconomic systems.
- 🛡️ [Collateral protection for Stakers](participants#operators).
