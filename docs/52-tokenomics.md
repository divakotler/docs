# Tokenomics

## Design principles

Diva is a Liquid Staking protocol aiming to create a collaborative environment under which Stakers and Operators can coordinate in a secure and efficient way.

The goal for its tokenomics is to find a collaborative and fee-less approach that does not involve extracting value from platform users. Instead, the aim is to establish a balance among all Diva users, being appropriately represented based on their level of engagement.

**The Tokenomic model is a work-in-progress, and it is the responsibility of the Diva DAO to decide on the ideal design for the protocol.**

### Design suggestions by the community

DIVA is a governance token allowing token holders to participate actively in its DAO governance.

The amount of DIVA “decision making power” for a participant shall correlate with their contributions to the platform; these contributions can be in the form of:

1. Developing and fostering the Diva Protocol: Contributing software, facilitating visualization tools, acting as relevant member of the community, etc.
2. Staking ETH through the Diva Protocol
3. Acting as an Operator at the Diva Protocol
4. Helping to create awareness and to decentralize the Diva Protocol.

The protocol should seek to reward good behavior to retain "good actors", while depriving "bad actors" from decision making power. This encourages participation in the protocol while making it more resilient.


### Potential retention mechanisms

Diva users that show a higher commitment with the protocol (such as Operators) are encouraged to engage even further by allowing them to use the DIVA token as collateral.

"Bad actors" acting in ways that may pose a risk to the community are discouraged from exercising decision power by retrieving their DIVA tokens through a penalties system.

The DAO is tasked with deciding on the exact mechanisms that the protocol will use.

## Potential distribution mechanisms

DIVA tokens could be distributed among:

- Stakers to provide decision making power to active participants aligned with its success.
- Reliable Operators, to incentivize a healthy and sustainable ecosystem.
- Key contributors in different areas.

Distribution mechanisms should aim to increase the decentralization ratio of the protocol, and sustain a diverse and ever growing community.
