# Introduction


Diva is a non-custodial Ethereum Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) protocol powered by Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). It is a vertically integrated protocol that offers depositors a liquid staking token that accrues value with staking rewards automatically without the need of running any infrastructure or trusting any central party. The network performs Distributed Validation with a group of bonded node operators that fulfill staking duties with a non-custodial model. Besides, it distributes staking rewards among the participants of this cooperative: Stakers, Operators, and the Diva DAO to balance the interests of the network.

While other solutions have features like liquid staking or DVT as tools, Diva is the only non-custodial solution that fully addresses the financial and technical barriers that Ethereum has.
