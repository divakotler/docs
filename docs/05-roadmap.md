# Roadmap

:::info
Diva is still under active development! Follow this page for updates 😊

**Next up: Operator Testnet coming early July 2023**
:::

## ✅ Staking testnet: live

The [Diva Staking Goerli testnet](https://stake.diva.community) is already live! It allows you to:

- ✅ Stake and withdraw your ETH.
- ✅ Wrap and unwrap your divETH into wdivETH.

There is also a [Dune Analytics dashboard for Diva testnet](https://dune.com/anchor/diva-goerli-network-dashboard) to visualize network data.

Other features in the roadmap are:

- 🔢 Rewards reporting UI.
- 🔌 DeFi integrations like stablecoins, lending, layer 2s, etc.

## ✅ Diva DAO: live

The [Diva DAO](dao) is entrusted to curate the Diva protocol, and the [Initial Distribution](distribution) is currently [available to eligible participants!](https://claim.diva.community/)




## 🛣️  Operator testnet

Diva's goal is that *anyone* can run a node to operate the network and generate staking rewards.

The community is working towards the following major releases:

1. **July: Amy Release**: Core validation functionality.
2. **Q3: Britney Release**: Improved consensus protocol, ZKP reward calculations.
3. **Q4: Cher Release**: MEV, tokenomics, governance, withdrawals.

**Mainnet deployment** will be performed once the last release (Cher) is fully audited and ready to be launched.

👷 This will allow Stakers, Operators and the Diva DAO to fully finalize its design and possibilities, so everybody can use divETH without the need to trust any centralized or permissioned party.
