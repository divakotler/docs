# The Diva DAO

## The motivation for Diva

**ðŸŒ³ Diva has been conceived as a public good, for the benefit of Ethereum Stakers and the ecosystem at large ðŸŒ³**

The protocol acts as a tool that allows Stakers and Operators to perform their tasks more efficiently and trustlessly, acting as an extension of the Ethereum protocol.


## The Diva DAO

The Diva DAO represents its users via the delegated DIVA token holders, who can exercise voting power.

As the Diva protocol doesn't extract any fees, its participants are entrusted to govern it as a public good.

There is a fixed total supply of 1 billion DIVA tokens. Each delegated DIVA token is worth 1 vote for decisions like:

- Deploying the Diva Smart Contracts.
- Curating the Diva Protocol by adjusting network parameters (if any).
- Evangelizating on the Diva Protocol.

In order to become voting DAO members, token holders must accept their role by delegating their vote to a delegate or to themselves.

The Diva DAO is entrusted to decide on the final design and operation of the Diva protocol.
