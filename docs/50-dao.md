# The Diva DAO

## The motivation for Diva

**ðŸŒ³ Diva has been conceived as a public good, for the benefit of Ethereum Stakers and the ecosystem at large.**

The protocol acts as a tool to allow Stakers and Operators to perform their tasks more efficiently and trustlessly.

## The Diva DAO

The Diva DAO was created to ensure that Diva is designed in the best interests of the community, giving its holders to power to decide on the future of the protocol.

The Diva DAO is formed by a fixed supply of 1 billion DIVA tokens.

Each DIVA token is worth 1 vote for decisions like:

- Deploying the Diva Smart Contracts.
- Adjusting network settings (if any).
- Governing the DAO treasury.

In order to become a Diva DAO member, token holders must accept their role by delegating their vote to a delegate or to themselves.
