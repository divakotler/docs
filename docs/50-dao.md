## The motivation for Diva

:::info
**ðŸŒ³ Diva has been conceived as a public good, for the benefit of Ethereum Stakers and the ecosystem at large ðŸŒ³**
:::

Diva is an automated and trustless software that extends Ethereum with additional functionality for Stakers and Operators.

This allows it to provide [Liquid Staking](lst) powered [Distributed Validation](dvt) in a [permissionless and trustless](features) manner, without extracting any protocol fees.

## The Diva DAO

The Diva DAO represents its users via the Delegated DIVA token holders, who can exercise voting power.

Delegated Diva Token holders are entrusted to govern it as a public good.

There is a fixed total supply of 1,000,000,000 DIVA tokens. Each Delegated DIVA token is worth 1 vote on decisions such as:

- Deploying the Diva Smart Contracts.
- Curating the Diva Protocol by adjusting network parameters (if any).
- Evangelizing for the Diva Protocol.

The Diva DAO components are fully decentralized:

- The DIVA contract is [0xbfabde619ed5c4311811cf422562709710db587d](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbfabde619ed5c4311811cf422562709710db587d).
- There is an active [DIVA Token Claim](https://claim.diva.community/) website.
- [Governance proposals](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/diva) are on Tally.
- [Discussion forum](https://commonwealth.im/divastaking/discussions) for community conversations on Commonwealth.

### Vote delegation

Participating in Diva governance can be demanding. For this reason, DIVA token holders are offered to either:

- [Select a delegate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/diva/delegates) to vote on their behalf, or
- [Self-delegate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/diva/my-voting-power) their tokens to vote directly.

**In order to become voting DAO members, token holders must accept their role by delegating their vote to a delegate or to themselves.**

The Diva DAO is entrusted with deciding on the final parameters for the launch and operation of the Diva protocol at launch.
