# The Diva DAO

## The motivation for Diva

**ðŸŒ³ Diva has been conceived as a public good, for the benefit of Ethereum Stakers and the ecosystem at large.**

The protocol acts as a balancing system between Stakers and Operators, allowing them to coordinate using cryptoeconomic incentives. 

## The Diva DAO

The Diva DAO was created to ensure that Diva is designed in the best interests of the community, giving its holders to power to decide on the future of the protocol.

The Diva DAO is formed by a fixed supply of 1 billion DIVA tokens.

Each DIVA token is worth 1 vote for decisions like:

- Deploying the Diva Smart Contracts.
- Adjusting network settings (if any).
- Governing the DAO treasury.
