  <summary>What is Diva?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>Diva is an Ethereum Liquid Staking protocol powered by Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). It is a vertically integrated protocol that offers depositors a liquid staking token that accrues value with staking rewards automatically without the need of running any infrastructure or trusting any central party. The network performs Distributed Validation with a group of bonded node operators that fulfill staking duties with a non-custodial model.
Diva is a community project, its code will be released fully open sourced and it will be universally accessible to anyone. 

**Summary:** Diva is an OS non-custodial Liquid Staking protocol which leverages Distributed Validation capabilities to create a permissionless network

  <summary>What’s the roadmap for the Diva network going forward?</summary>
  <div>
<div>
Diva is a community first project. It is the intention of the early contributors to the Diva project to become a public good helping Ethereum to become more decentralized and resilient when increasing the participation of small stakers and operators within the Ethereum ecosystem. Once the testnet and auditing phases have been completed it is the intention of Diva early contributor’s to release in Gnosis Chain first to make Diva publicly accessible in Ethereum mainnet afterwards.  

**Summary:** Diva is in testnet at the moment, after the code is fully audited it will be released in Gnosis Chain and in Ethereum mainnet

  <summary>What is the difference between Diva and other liquid staking platforms such as 
Lido or Rocketpool?</summary>
  <div>
<div>
Diva leverages its own developed system of distributed validation. That implies an increase on the resilience of the whole Diva network while guaranteeing a wider decentralization of the validation process bringing more participants to the Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem.


**Summary:** Diva leverages DVT technology to create a full liquid staking ecosystem getting higher a decentralization and resilience levels than other liquid staking protocols

  <summary>What is the difference between Diva and DVT services such as Obol and SSV?</summary>
  <div>
<div>
Among other things, Obol and SSV use the same consensus algorithm while Diva has 
developed its own. Further, both Obol and SSV are middleware solutions while Diva 
is an end-to -end liquid staking network. 


**Summary:** Diva is an end-to-end liquid staking and validation network using an innovative 
consensus mechanism
