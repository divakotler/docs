## How to Stake

### Directly on the staker web interface

Staking by the web interface:
- Easiest way to stake
- underlying smart contracts work
- The main benefit is that you know for sure that divETH/ETH is always 1:1, no extra fee  whatsoever but the disadvantage is that the transaction cost (gas) might be very expensive regardless the ETH you deposit so for small amounts this may not be the best option.  

## ðŸ’ Â Step-by-step Guide to Staking

</div>

5. Now, all that's left to do is enter the amount you would like to withdraw, and click the big blue "Unstake" button!
    - Confirm the transaction in Metamask.
    - When confirmed the transaction will go through and when completed the divETH balance in your wallet will be updated.

Note: Trading divETH back for ETH is only possible when the staking liquidity pool has enough ETH in it to handle your trade. Otherwise an exit needs to be performed. So the withdrawal is guaranteed but not immediately.

The source of the ETH is from both Stakers and Operators.
