# Early Adopters

## Governance power belongs to users

The Diva DAO is tasked with distributing DIVA governance tokens to increase its base of active community members, aiming to reach the highest possible level of resilience and decentralization.

Over the next weeks, expect to find more information for Early Adopters on ways to get involved with the protocol and take over responsibility shaping the Diva protocol!
